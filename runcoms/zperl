# Perl

# If Perl hase been installed through homebrew:
# brew install perl

# Caveats:
# By default non-brewed cpan modules are installed to the Cellar. If you wish
# for your modules to persist across updates we recommend using `local::lib`.
# You can set that up like this:
# PERL_MM_OPT="INSTALL_BASE=$HOME/.perl5" cpan local::lib
# echo 'eval "$(perl -I$HOME/.perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib=$HOME/.perl5)"' >> ~/.zshrc

if [[ -f "/usr/local/bin/perl" ]]; then
  # Perl has been installed locally
  alias perl='/usr/local/bin/perl'
  alias cpan='/usr/local/bin/cpan'
  eval "$(/usr/local/bin/perl -I$HOME/.perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib=$HOME/.perl5)"
